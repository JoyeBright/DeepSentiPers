## Getting started

All the things you need to work on this project is an Ipython environment like the *Google Colab* or *Jupyter* and the dataset files.

## Dataset

The dataset is used in this project was collected from *[SentiPers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07737)* corpus. It contains 7419 Persian sentences and their relative polarity.
The original and augmented dataset files are accessible in the "*Dataset*" folder.
