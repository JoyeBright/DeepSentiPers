       " it was also a wonderful introduction to preparing food for our 3 year old daughter." \
       " Ever since her Grandpa bought this for her, she's made everything from a cheese sandwhich to a triple decker salami club!" \
       " She had so much fun playing with this toy, that she started to become interested in how I prepared meals." \
       " She now is very eager to spread peanut butter and jam, layer turkey and cheese and help mix cake batter." \
       " Set comes with cute red basket and 13 pieces of sandwich. A very cute gift to give a girl or boy."
